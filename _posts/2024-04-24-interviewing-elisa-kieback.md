Elisa Kieback, co-founder of the biopharmaceutical company T-knife, was well-set on an academic journey by her researcher parents. She trained as a biologist and moved around, pursuing opportunities in Heidelberg and Glasgow. Elisa settled in Berlin at the Max Delbr√ºck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) studying T cell receptors.

Eventually, she floated in postdoc space's uncertainties, where mentors helped her find new purposes. She used her group's research and training to start Berlin's most successful pharma and biotech startup in recent times.
