In this episode, Xenia and Kathi catch up with Bejamin Harris, a former zoology student turned wildlife camera operator, whose work has taken him from Cornish coastlines to crocodile-filled caves in Gabon. Now filming for the BBC and other production companies, Ben shares his unconventional journey – from feeling like an outsider at university to building a career that combines storytelling, adventure and conservation.

He reflects on discovering filmmaking through GoPro clips and side projects, retraining with an MSc in Science Communication, and moving to Bristol – the epicentre of wildlife documentaries in the UK – with £2,500 and a spreadsheet of cold contacts. With honesty and humour, Ben talks about life on location, ethical work, and balancing the thrill of exciting wild encounters with the realities of being away for months at a time.
