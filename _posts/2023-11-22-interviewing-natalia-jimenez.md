In this episode, Natalia Jim√©nez, Global Life Science Lead at CGG, discusses her transition from academia to industry. After 14 years of academic research, she was offered a position in a technology company doing bioinformatics, a field she was not particularly trained in. She took the challenge and found the commercial environment, doing business development in health and life sciences, to be very enriching. Natalia enjoyed the discussions with her colleagues, transforming their struggles into opportunities for her company.
