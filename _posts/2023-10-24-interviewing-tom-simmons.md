Tom Simmons, co-founder and CEO of the Supplant Company, dreamed of becoming a full professor in biochemistry. Eventually, he launched a venture through the prestigious Y Combinator program to make our food more sustainable and sugar-free. Tom kicked off his career with an undergraduate degree in biochemistry.

He later pursued a postdoc in plant science at the University of Cambridge. His interest in the renewable use of plant materials, particularly in the context of bioenergy and biofuels, guided his scientific pursuits.

However, it wasn't until he joined the entrepreneurial postdoc society and participated in entrepreneurship programs that he began considering starting his own business, which eventually evolved through various business models before settling on producing natural sugars.
